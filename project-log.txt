This file is a project log of what activities/problems etc. were being done and when.


It is written using NOTEPAD where the date and time is supplied by pressing key 'F5'

It will also show what websites were visited and a small explanation of why or what waslearnt by visiting the websites.


During this project, the source code file will be saved as a new file as time goes on.

This will provide me with a regular 'fire break' in the event of me making a huge mistake and not being able to 'undo' the problem.

The filenames will contain a date in ISO8601 format with a version letter next.
This will provide maximum ability to backtrack if 
needed but also provide the date (and OpSys time) of the last edit date/time of each file.

In Quality Control and Statistcs- there is a parameter for a set of measurement called RANGE.
Sadly you cant have a function called   def range(x,y,z):  because  range is a reserved word.

Now - finally finished text based processing and output.
Looks good.
But I dont know if it would be better as a CSV file as well.
or would a CSV and TXT file output be best or too much?

Enough for one night.



20:26 26/03/2018
Thinking about project and calculating standard deviation...
If I put a binary 1/0 switch in the StdDev calculating function then I could switch between
calculating a sample/population standard deviation.
It allows the program to switch between the two by only changing one variable in the setup section of the program.

21:04 27/03/2018
Thinking:
Should the report output be text or be another csv file?
If a CSv file, then the various params for each aspect of the IRIS should be placed under the applicable column
so that the output can be pasted in under the CSV values for the IRIS data.

Monday night was a day off from programming but not thinking.
Did enough on Sunday night to to get a basic project finished.

Will resume with 
1. check the average and standard deviation calculations 
2. possibly revisit getting the standard deviation by a built in function instead of my own.
3. re-arranging the TXT output
4. Deciding if it needs a CSV output as well
5. creating the basic X-Y graphs.
6. And if they work then bar charts and a scatter graph or two would be nice.


Then, as if that wasn't enough, later on
Think if IRIS data needs a HEATMAP and other graphs that will be useful for other stuff.


21:37 27/03/2018
Edited the stddev(x[],'y') function to enable the ability to process an array that has a sample or the population in it.
This removes the assumption to always consider the supplied array to be a sample. 
The main program can now tell the function which to use.


21:43 27/03/2018
THINKING:
Thought of replacing the fixed text in each print() with variables and setting the variables to suitable text at the start of the program.
This again allows for the program to be setup easily and not have to go into the code to find every print() to change the text.
The extensiono f this is then to supply a file that has all the output 'phrases' in whatever language to be read in before the 
program produces any output to the screen or to a file.
It is not a lot of work to do but is it needed ?
Will it gain any 'points' ?

21:46 27/03/2018
Will add that to my list of things to do.
1. check the average and standard deviation calculations 
2. possibly revisit getting the standard deviation by a built in function instead of my own.
3. re-arranging the TXT output
4. Deciding if it needs a CSV output as well
5. creating the basic X-Y graphs.
6. And if they work then bar charts and a scatter graph or two would be nice.
7. create variables for each output (screen or file) string and set the values of these variables at the start of the program.
8. consider creating an INIT file with these phrases/strings in it and read this file in to overwrte the default values.
 

22:06 27/03/2018
THINKING
because I'm using APPEND for the TEXT output, It might be better to clean out any existing file contents.
To do this I can either just delete any existing file but I will have to cater for an error of 'file not found' or 
I can just have small extra function to OPEN FOR OVERWRITE but not write anything.
This will have the effect of leaving an empty file to writing to (append) later when the program produces its report.

9. create a function to open for overwrite and then close to clear out any existing report output contents.
