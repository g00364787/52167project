This file is a project log of what activities/problems etc. were being done and when.


It is written using NOTEPAD where the date and time is supplied by pressing key 'F5'

It will also show what websites were visited and a small explanation of why or what waslearnt by visiting the websites.


During this project, the source code file will be saved as a new file as time goes on.

This will provide me with a regular 'fire break' in the event of me making a huge mistake and not being able to 'undo' the problem.

The filenames will contain a date in ISO8601 format with a version letter next.
This will provide maximum ability to backtrack if 
needed but also provide the date (and OpSys time) of the last edit date/time of each file.

Enough for one night.



20:26 26/03/2018
Thinking about project and calculating standard deviation...
If I put a binary 1/0 switch in the StdDev calculating function then I could switch between
calculating a sample/population standard deviation.
It allows the program to switch between the two by only changing one variable in the setup section of the program.

21:04 27/03/2018
Thinking:
Should the report output be text or be another csv file?
If a CSv file, then the various params for each aspect of the IRIS should be placed under the applicable column
so that the output can be pasted in under the CSV values for the IRIS data.

Monday night was a day off from programming but not thinking.
Did enough on Sunday night to to get a basic project finished.

Will resume with 
1. check the average and standard deviation calculations 
2. possibly revisit getting the standard deviation by a built in function instead of my own.
3. re-arranging the TXT output
4. Deciding if it needs a CSV output as well
5. creating the basic X-Y graphs.
6. And if they work then bar charts and a scatter graph or two would be nice.


Then, as if that wasn't enough, later on
Think if IRIS data needs a HEATMAP and other graphs that will be useful for other stuff.


21:37 27/03/2018
Edited the stddev(x[],'y') function to enable the ability to process an array that has a sample or the population in it.
This removes the assumption to always consider the supplied array to be a sample. 
The main program can now tell the function which to use.


21:43 27/03/2018
THINKING:
Thought of replacing the fixed text in each print() with variables and setting the variables to suitable text at the start of the program.
This again allows for the program to be setup easily and not have to go into the code to find every print() to change the text.
The extensiono f this is then to supply a file that has all the output 'phrases' in whatever language to be read in before the 
program produces any output to the screen or to a file.
It is not a lot of work to do but is it needed ?
Will it gain any 'points' ?

21:46 27/03/2018
Will add that to my list of things to do.
1. check the average and standard deviation calculations 
2. possibly revisit getting the standard deviation by a built in function instead of my own.
3. re-arranging the TXT output
4. Deciding if it needs a CSV output as well
5. creating the basic X-Y graphs.
6. And if they work then bar charts and a scatter graph or two would be nice.
7. create variables for each output (screen or file) string and set the values of these variables at the start of the program.
8. consider creating an INIT file with these phrases/strings in it and read this file in to overwrte the default values.
 

22:06 27/03/2018
THINKING
Because I'm using APPEND for the TEXT output, It might be better to clean out any existing file contents.
To do this I can either just delete any existing file but I will have to cater for an error of 'file not found' or 
I can just have small extra function to OPEN FOR OVERWRITE but not write anything.
This will have the effect of leaving an empty file to writing to (append) later when the program produces its report.

22:24 27/03/2018
Thats enough thinking.

22:28 27/03/2018
Sadly couldn't resist/stop.
Created report file overwrite routine to clean the report file back to an empty file.
Added some comment lines to screen to inform user of programs activity.
Changes the word "Count" in the report output (to file+screen) to the word "Samples"
Latest filename is now 'gmit--project--20180327q.py'


22:37 27/03/2018
Latest filename is now 'gmit--project--20180327r.py'
Reworked the sample_R_population variable.
And reworked the calling of the STATSOF() to include 3 arguments to enable the switching of  SAMPLE or POPULATION calculations.


23:59 27/03/2018
Filename now = gmit--project--20180327s.py
Adjusted the layout of the report output so that the statistics are in a more logical sequence.
Now, the sequence is 
	Samples			// in Statistics is shown by	n
	Maximum			// in Statistics is shown by	Max
	Minimum			// in Statistics is shown by	Min
	Range			// in Statistics is shown by	R
	Average			// in Statistics is shown by	X_bar  or  x_bar

	Std Dev			// in Statistics is shown by	Sigma  or  s


00:02 28/03/2018
Changed the return value from function  def cleanreportfile(): to return 0

02:29 23/04/2018
Now using filename 'gmit--project--20180423D.py'
Added Normal-Probability plot using the scatterplot upon some internally calculated array.
The idea of the Normal-Probabilty graph is to plot the sorted values of the input array over an equal stepped value 
that is calculated by x / N+1 where N is the number of elements in the input array.
If the resulting graph looks like a S curve or close to it then it is effectively a bell-curve but if it is closer to 
a horizontal line then it is closer to being a very narrow sample (Range is very small)

03:16 23/04/2018
Put near final touches to program.
Must stop now.

07:20 23/04/2018
Now using filename 'gmit--project--20180423e.py'
Re-arranged the NormProb to be a  Y-X graph so that a narrow-bell-curve would be shown by an almost narrow vertical line 
rather than a near-narrow horizontal line.
When I learned about these graphs, the Vertical S rather than a horizontal S was the way shown.
A narrow-S curve implies a narrow bell-curve and a narrow bell-curve implies low variance.
A near diagonal S-curve implies a wide bell curve therefore implies high variance.

00:05 25/04/2018
Idea to add a relationship indicator of  STD DEV -v- RANGE and if the data stands a chance of being normal then the ratio should be 1:6
This would be a simple  X/Y where the result would be the  '6' part of the ratio.
